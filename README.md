# Description

Gunnerfy is a set of convenience commands that wrap the AWS (CLI, AppSync and Amplify), Serverless Framework, React and Expo and assist in the setup and workflow of a serverless platform in a multi-developer team, leveraging AWS best practices.

If you are not familiar with the above technology stack, Gunnerfy is not for you.

Setup is based off of [this starter template](https://github.com/gunnertech/aws-severless-react-template)

# Setup

## Prerequisites

Install the following

1. Brew: ``$ /usr/bin/ruby -e "$(curl -fsSL https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Homebrew/install/master/install)"``
1. Python: ``$ brew install python; brew upgrade python``
1. [AWS CLI](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/cli/latest/userguide/cli-chap-install.html#install-tool-pip) or ``$ brew install awscli; brew upgrade awscli``
1. Setup your aws cli if you haven't: ``aws configure``
1. [Git](https://git-scm.com/book/en/v2/Getting-Started-Installing-Git)
1. [NVM](https://github.com/creationix/nvm#installation-and-update)
1. Node: ``nvm install 12``

## Installation
````
$ nvm use 12
$ npm install git+ssh://git@github.com/gunnertech/gunnerfy.git -g
````

## Create a new Platform
````
$ gunnerfy new <project-name> -o <organization-name>
````

### Examples

#### Fine Grained Access Control

Allow gunnerfy to create a new group for each environment.

This gives developers fine-grained access to the different environments, i.e., developers can only access their environment and not the staging, production environments.

````
$ gunnerfy new sample-project -o SampleClient
$ gunnerfy new sample-project -o SampleClient -s staging
$ gunnerfy new sample-project -o SampleClient -s production
````

#### Lax Access Control

If you only want one group created for all the environments in the project, pass a group name to the command.

This will create fewer groups, but each environment will be in one group, meaning a developer in the group will have access to all of the environments.

````
$ gunnerfy new sampleProject -o SampleClient -g sampleProjectGroup
$ gunnerfy new sampleProject -o SampleClient -s staging  -g sampleProjectGroup
$ gunnerfy new sampleProject -o SampleClient -s production  -g sampleProjectGroup
````

## Sentry

When you create the project in sentry, make sure you use the exact ``<project-name>`` as the project name

1. [Create a new project](https://sentry.io/organizations/gunner-technology/projects/new/)
2. Note the url (i.e. https://xxxxxxxxx@sentry.io/xxxxx)
3. ``gunnerfy set-var -n sentry-url -v <url>``



# Adding a Team Member
1. Dev requests access to ``<base-stage>`` from team lead (where pull requests are submitted, i.e. staging) with their IAM ``<user-name>``
1. If approved, team lead will add dev's IAM user to the IAM group with access to base-stage

````
$ gunnerfy users add -u <user-name> -s <base-stage>
````

2. The app will print the team lead a command to send to the new developer for them to run like this:
````
$ gunnerfy add-project <project-name> -s <baseStage>
````

# RDS Schema Migrations and Codegen (optional)

While DynamoDB is the default data store, Gunnerfy also allows teams to build a serverless datastore using MySQL on RDS.

````
$ cd <project-name>
$ gunnerfy generate migration -n <migration-name> -s <sql-statement>
$ gunnerfy migrate
$ amplify env checkout <stage>
$ amplify api add-graphql-datasource
````

# Workflow

## Running Locally

### Backend (ALWAYS RUN THIS)

````
$ gunnerfy develop
````

### React Client 

````
$ cd react-client
$ STAGE=<stage> npm run start
````

### React Native Client 

````
$ cd react-native-client
$ STAGE=<stage> npm run <simulator> (ios|android)
````

## Start of iteration
````
$ git checkout <base-stage (staging|prodution>; git pull; # this makes sure you have the latest code and hotfixes
$ git checkout <stage>; git merge <base-stage>
$ amplify env checkout <stage>
````

## Work on issues
````
$ git checkout -b <issue-number>
$ # work work work
$ gunnerfy deploy backend # if you need to make backend changes
$ git add .; git commit -am “closes #<issue-number>”
$ git checkout <stage>
$ git merge <issue-number>
$ git push
$ git branch -D <issue-number>
$ # Repeat on all issues assigned
````

## Submit pull request

Each developer on the project will submit a pull request at the end of the iteration

````
$  gunnerfy git-submit -i <iteration-end-date: (format: YYYYMMDD)> -t <target-stage>
````

## Approve pull requests

Team lead reviews and approves pull requests

````
$ gunnerfy git-approve -i <request-id> -s <stage> # gunnerfy git-approve -i 2 -s staging
$ # repeat above for all pull requests
$ gunnerfy git-tag -s <stage> -i <iteration-end-date (format: YYYYMMDD)>
````  


## Deploying


### Backend

````
$ gunnerfy deploy backend -s <stage>
````

### React Native Front End
````
$ gunnerfy deploy mobile -s <stage>
````
### React Front End

````
$ gunnerfy deploy web -s <stage>
````

## Accounts

If you want to delete an account, simply close the account.

However, you should also remove the IAM Group and IAM Policy in the main account as well
